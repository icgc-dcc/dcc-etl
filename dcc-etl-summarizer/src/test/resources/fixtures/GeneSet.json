  "description": "The target of the mitotic checkpoint is the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins whose destruction is essential for mitotic exit. Currently, there are two proposed mechanism by which inhibition of the APC/C is achieved. These mechanisms differ depending on the mechanism of signal transduction. The APC/C may be inhibited directly by association with the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) or through the sequestration of its activator, Cdc20. ",
