  # Note that the following database setting *must* be set this way in order to ensure that 
  # a second connection is never created. This is because the act of creating a 
  # connection will source the "runscript" identified above. This effectively
  # will empty the database. This was originally observed when the idle validation
  # query was doing just this. To get more insigt, enable tracing:
